So Moderna is obviously known due to how we help the global community with COVID But it's really much more than that. It is a platform company revolving around mRNA, which really makes the proteins in a body. And those proteins can help either fight infectious diseases and prevent against any kind of infectious disease, or be a therapy. And we can get into the segments that we're in, but it can be an oncology, it can be in rare disease. And we actually believed, and that was the principal belief in the company, is if this platform can work, it's going to be able, since it's part of your natural body, it's going to be able to help solve many different therapeutic areas in the body. And so that's a little bit about Moderna. And over the last 13 years, we've built a pipeline of 45 drug candidates. Obviously, we're known for COVID, but also in other respiratory diseases. We hope to launch our second drug this year, RSV, which became pretty well known last year as it had a pretty significant spike, but also in flu and other respiratory diseases. And then in oncology, we've got an exciting cancer therapy that we are excited about, rare diseases and other latent diseases. So that's a little bit about Moderna.

But what is the envelope? Where are we going to spend it? How much goes into our investment in our R and D pipeline? How much goes into capital expenditure into SG and A? The third is to support decision making across the company. And train our teams to understand how to measure return on investment. And how to think through decisions that are made every single day. Thousands of decisions across the company every single day. And then the last is stakeholder management. Whether it's investors, employees, the board of directors, customers, partners, suppliers.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (06:39): Yeah, you're absolutely right. And maybe just to talk about that process, we call it. You know, we take a drug from pure research to kind of preclinical, which doesn't go into a human body. And you're kind of testing how it works in animals. And then it gets into an INd process or a new drug candidate. And there are phase one, phase two, phase three. And you're right. I mean, the probability of success from basic research all the way through. Not only getting it launched with the FDA in the United States as an example, but there's healthcare regulators all across the globe. And then commercial success as well. So there's a ton of risk that goes into it. And that's what we spend our time doing. And we as a platform company, believe that we've been studying the science of mRNA in different verticals. A vertical might be respiratory vaccines, as I mentioned. And if we know that our mRNA platform can work with COVID Then we have a high conviction that it can work with RSV. And a high conviction that it can work with flu and other respiratory. And so we de risk that throughout the process. We do it in basic research. We do it in preclinical, we do it in phase one trials, phase two trials. And all those trials are just more patients. So you might start with literally ten to 15 patients in phase one and then a respiratory trial. Our RSV trial for phase three was 37,000 patients. And you just continue to assess what is the risk and what is the capabilities. And so that's what we spend a ton of time doing when we think about allocating capital to our pipeline in our next drug candidates.", "edited_transcript": "Jamey (06:39):\nYeah, you're absolutely right.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (08:35): Sure, yeah, there's a lot, but I'll kind of summarize it into a few, which is getting back to that sense of risk and comparing it to our capabilities. So I mentioned we have a higher conviction in respiratory vaccines, so therefore it's much easier to place bets and further dollars behind respiratory vaccines. We are currently hoping to de risk our latent vaccine therapeutic area. We've recently de risked our oncology area, which we call individualized neoantigen therapy, which is a mouthful, but in essence it helps stimulate t cells to attack cancer. And so when we look through it, we say, okay, what is the mRNA capabilities? Have we de risked this area? And therefore every step of the way allocate more dollars. So that's number one. Number two is we look at the size of the opportunity. So this really isn't any different than any business case for any company, in any industry. You know, respiratory vaccines is a very large market. We think it's a $30 billion market between flu, COVID, RSV. So, and there's only a few players and there's a very high barrier to entry because you have to test so many patients in those trials, they're quite expensive. Third is, what's the competition and what's our commercial, you know, capabilities? Will we be successful? Will we have something that differentiates our product versus another product? And then the fourth is timing, particularly when you're, we're still a relatively young biotech company, 13 years old is not that old in the grand scheme of things. And so therefore we have to understand, okay, what's our cash balance? Well, you know, how much revenue and profit are we going to be generating in the next few years? And therefore we want to turn over the portfolio to not just be a COVID company, but to be a multi drug company in various different areas. And so therefore, we look at, well, is this going to start generating revenue in 2025, 2026 or some of these won't be till 2035. So we have to kind of balance all those things to make sure that we have a sustainable company and bring the most drugs to market with the highest probability of success.", "edited_transcript": "Jamey (08:35):\nSure, yeah, there's a lot, but I'll summarize it into a few, which is getting back to that sense of risk and comparing it to our capabilities.

How do you decide where to put that money to work? And I guess, how granular do those decisions actually get? Is there like a line item for R and D expenses every year and it's just like a big bundle and then there are people who are specifically dedicated to dividing that up?

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (14:54): Yeah. So first thing I tell every industry, we could certainly spend a lot more than four and a half billion dollars, and that is a wonderful thing, because the minute we run out of ideas and pipelines, we're in trouble and we'll stop growing. So it is definitely a hot debate, I would say, in terms of where we're going to allocate our capital. But let me just give you, maybe I'd say three processes that we run. Great. So first off, we have twice a year, a look at our entire portfolio, and we call it a strategy review to understand, okay, let's make these decisions. Given the envelope of capital we have, let's prioritize these things and we pull together. It's extremely cross functional. It is even within R and D. There are many different functions within R and D. And we bring in all of those people that are product specialists or epidemiologists or development specialists, etcetera. We bring in the finance team to obviously run the financials and understand the reward, the commercial team to understand the size of the opportunity. And we debate and say, okay, strategically, as a company, if we want to be this year, we think we'll be 4 billion in sales. If we want to get to, I'll just make it up a number, say $10 billion in sales by 2027, if that's a priority. That's not the only priority, but that is a priority to say, okay, let's have that lens on it, number one. Number two, here's another lens. We want to diversify our revenue stream, so we don't want to be solely a respiratory business. So we got to make sure we are investing in other latent areas, latent disease areas, or oncology, that we also want to bring to market. And we have those strategic, and that kind of sets the foundation then. So that's process one that happens twice a year, and we figure out which products we want to fund in theory, and that's what we start operating, too. But then there's underlying research and clinical trials that are going on every single day, and there's report outs, and you might get different data, different answers. That actually changes that. And that is a very well governed process that we call a stage gate process. And as an example, you know, I myself have to approve whether we go to a phase three trial because those are very expensive, as I mentioned earlier. So, you know, but there are gates into, even before it gets into the clinic, there's gates in the research area, in preclinical area, and then there's gates before you go to phase one, phase two, phase three, and those, you know, we have a theory based on the strategy of what we wanted to invest in, but new data comes out and you have to adjust to it. So I'd say that's kind of the second process that is highly governed. So you have this top level strategy, then you have actual data that's coming through that is well governed. And then the last thing is, particularly on how much we're going to spend and whether we go and spend more on these phase three trials. We actually take it to a subcommittee of the board. So the board of directors, which we have some scientists and doctors that are on our board and oversee it and have a lot of experience, also govern. Yeah, we think it's worth. We get it. We get the strategy. It fits into our strategy. We understand the risks and we think you should move forward. So those are kind of three different processes in terms of how we govern our product strategy.", "edited_transcript": "Jamey (14:54):\nYeah, so first thing, I tell every industry, we could certainly spend a lot more than four and a half billion dollars.

As you and I spoke beforehand, Joe, I wasn't here during COVID I joined the company at the end of 2022, in September of 22. So I've been here for 18 months. So I obviously am aware of what went on, but I don't know all the intimate details, so I'll give you my general opinion and impression. And, you know, warp speed, I forget the exact money, but I think it, you know, might be in the range of a billion dollars. Don't quote me on that. It's in our disclosures. You can actually pull it up and get the exact numbers, but it was not insignificant. And I think this is an example of a terrific public private partnership that actually did great for the world. And to put that into perspective, and it wasn't just the funding, by the way, we can get into. There was so much help throughout the entire process in 2020, in many different areas, shipping vendors, et cetera, a lot of red tape to cut through. But it actually proves that in one year, we went from COVID that came out, we identified the vaccine in two days, and we got it approved for market in eleven months. That is unparalleled in the pharmaceutical biotech industry. And so it shows you the art of the possible. There is good reason why things are regulated, because there's safety concerns and we have to do that, but it also shows you that you can accelerate this timeline if you cut through some red tape for something that has been very powerful, very safe and effective, and really has changed the world in a very rapid way. So I am a huge believer in the success of that. In terms of the APA's, I mean, think about our situation. We had zero revenue and we were asked to go invest literally hundreds and billions of dollars to get this over the hump. It was a make or break decision for us. I mean, we were sitting there going, we were public company. You could run out of cash in a heartbeat. And so we needed a partner to help take that risk. And ultimately it worked out and worked very well. So the APAs, to your second part of your question, there were very important, because we had to know that if we're going to go invest all this money and in our infrastructure, forget about the research and development, we have to bring on six different manufacturing partners across the globe. We had to go make purchase commitments for inventory in the billions of dollars with part, you know, to say, hey, we need to make a lot of COVID doses over a billion on that time period, that we made a billion doses out of this. And we had, that was a lot of risk. We needed to know that we were going to get some return, otherwise, you know, we were going to turn upside down. So Apas were important. I believe that a partnership can work quite well, and in this example, I think it works extremely well. I get that there needs to be regulation for many different reasons, but I think that shows you the art of the possible, both in public private partnerships as well as what can happen when you really try to expedite the regulatory process.", "edited_transcript": "Jamey (21:14):\nSure, yeah.

You know, day to day, stocks going to jump all around, a little bit up, a little bit down. That happens all the time. So I try to assess. Okay, number one, is it a specific event for us, a news item, whether it's a regulatory update on a clinical trial, or whether we gave, you know, guidance on financials or whatever it might be, is it a specific event? Did we do it well? We take that quite seriously. And did we communicate it well? Were we clear? Do people get it? Do investors get it? And even if they get it, if it's bad news, the stock may go down, but they understand it, and there's a natural implication to that. Or if the stock goes up, they are clearly understanding the message of what we're trying to say. So I try to understand, number one, is there a specific event for us? The everyday events in terms of just the global economy and interest rates worry me less. We're fortunate, as I mentioned, to have $13 billion in cash. We don't take it lightly. We try to understand what that means for us over the coming years in terms of, okay, what's going to happen from a demand perspective or the cash in the bank, will it return interest? And so we obviously are cognizant of the implications on our company. But overall, I think we spend the most time focusing on our investors understanding the long term opportunity for our company. And I think that's what's critical for many companies. And it is hard to have investors really look at the long term, and different portfolio managers and investors have a different view on what is long term, whether that's 24 months, five years, ten years. And we try to make sure that people understand what is the opportunity ahead. And actually, if they are saying it back to us, then at least they understand it, and they might make a different decision, might wait for it, you know, and we try to understand what does that mean in terms of their buying behavior.

So I think if there's a big move and we should be doing this all the time, but there's something to listen to. And so I'll just take myself out of Moderna. I mean, if you're a CFO and your stock goes down 20%, that is a substantial amount of investors saying it is less valuable. Something's going on. And I think what you have to listen for is, do we already know that, or is it something that we really have, we got to think differently about? So is our revenue line not going to be what we think it's going to be? And the investors are ahead of us because they see something in the marketplace that is changing. And if that's the case, then sometimes, I mean, I take our conversations with investors as a two way learning. I learn from them. They give me their thoughts on what they think, where the market's going, where we're positioned, how we're positioned, how successful they think we're going to be, just as much as I try to tell them our view. And so it is a two way learning. And especially when there's a huge market move or significant market move, they're telling you something. And the question what you have to sift through is, did we already know that and therefore just stay the course on strategy? Or is it something that, hey, we might need to think differently about, and perhaps we're wrong on one of our assumptions.

I think it was from March 2020. So right in the heart of the pandemic. And it opens with a discussion of the Gartman hype cycle and this idea that, you know, people get really excited about a new technology. You see share prices of these tech companies go through the roof, and then there's some adjustment process or reality kind of sets in, the shares fall, and then slowly there's a recovery as people kind of enter realistic productivity and use of these new technologies. And looking at the Moderna share price since March of 2020, it really does look like a Gartman hype cycle. Like, if you're going to choose a textbook example, it's kind of this. So I guess my question is, like, how, how do you balance people getting really enthusiastic about new technological breakthroughs and all these new treatments we have in the pipeline? I mean, I don't think you're working on this specifically, but GLP one, weight loss drugs are obviously something that's kind of burst into the public consciousness recently. How do you balance that excitement and the hype versus, like, the reality of putting these in production? And again, going back to the timelines that you were discussing, the idea of long term investment, like, don't get too excited.

But I also just think that COVID was such a significant event that affected the entire global population that it warranted both resources from a time perspective as well as money perspective. And that's not to say that these other ones don't, but it just, it was a crisis. And so, you know, there are areas in oncology that I think there's additional funding going behind. I think people learning, okay, rare disease, I hear a lot of talk. Again, I am not a scientist. I am not a regulator, so take it with a grain of salt. But rare disease as an example, it's rare by nature, so it's difficult to say. It's difficult to actually get enough patients and data to progress fast because of the regulatory processes. And I think the regulators acknowledge that and say, hey, if I only have, I'm going to make it up a hundred patients in the United States, this might take ten years, but I can already tell in two years, in a phase one trial, it's making a significant impact on 15 patients. And these are life threatening diseases. It's worth taking the risk. So it might not be at the same speed and emphasis as Operation war speed, but I have seen a couple areas in oncology and rare disease, and maybe that's, you know, quite honestly, that's where I am personally spending time. So I see those things, and maybe it's happening in other areas, but I'm just not as knowledgeable as all other therapeutic areas. But I do see it a little bit more in oncology and rare disease.

And obviously with medicines, we are not talking about getting into stores. We're talking about getting into hospitals and pharmacies and doctors offices.

If CV's does not have the flu shot available, there's a chance that you might not go back for it. And so the importance of being, having the supply in the market when a patient wants and needs it is extremely important. And distribution plays a role in that. There's also many different things that you have to work through in terms of storage. Some products are required to be refrigerator stable. Some are required to be frozen at a certain temperature. Some are required to be frozen at a very cold temperature, and making sure that the distribution network has that as well. So the conversation largely revolves around that. What can they do to make sure that we have the right amount of products in the right channels? And by channels, for our industry, that means pharmacies and or doctors offices, and there's other places to put it as well, you know. But that's largely what that conversation does.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (39:58): They are so similar. So let me paint the aviation business that I worked in for GE, which was. I was in the commercial engines division, commercial engines and services. So think of, you know, the 737 Max, a partnership with a company out of France, and GE called CFM, is the. Is the engine on that aircraft. And so when I was a CFO there, you're making bets on product families that will be on aircraft for literally 40 years. And these are substantial investments. We're talking two, $3 billion for a company to invest in. And you have to make the right bet. Are you on the right aircraft? Because, you know, you can put an engine on a bad aircraft and your engine might be great, but if nobody buys the aircraft, it's irrelevant. So not only do you need to make the best engine, you need to put it on the right aircraft, people need to buy it, and then you need to obviously do everything else. Well, from an execution standpoint, that is no different here. I mean, we are making, you know, I mentioned our RSV product as an example. 37,000 patients. It's in the hundreds of millions of dollars from an investment perspective. But once it's ready, and if it's there, you know, that RSV vaccine probably won't be tweaked too much. Maybe a little bit of tweaking over time, but we've just cleared a high barrier of entry, where as of right now, there's only two competitors, and in the aviation space, there's largely three competitors. So they're very similar. And so the funding. So let's just give an example. Maybe give you a specific example. When I was at aviation, you think through that $3 billion program, and we had what we called risk and revenue share partners, which was somebody to say, hey, we can't invest in six product families times $3 billion each. We're going to have to have some partners that they'll make part of the engine, and they'll help invest in the technology, and they can share in the commercial rewards that can be very similar in pharma, biotech. So I mentioned Merck in our partnership. They funded $250 million back in 2016, and additional monies since thereafter, and they own 50% of that program. So when you're thinking about pulling together this entire pipeline across many different therapeutic areas, and they all cost a lot of money to develop, you need partnerships, and that partnership can provide more than just money. In the case of Merck, they are great from a commercial perspective. They sell the leading oncology drug on the planet, and the same in the aviation plant world, you got to have people that might make the best part of the engine that you're talking about to improve fuel consumption. So they're very similar models, one that I think about quite a bit. And on top of that, maybe the last thing I'd say is they're both highly regulated. I already mentioned the biotech space, but aviation, as you know, the FAA and other agencies across, across the globe highly regulate the aviation space to make sure that it is very safe to fly aircraft across the globe.", "edited_transcript": "Jamey (39:58):\nThey are so similar.

I think everyone was so interested in the fate and fortunes of this owl is because he was actually a eurasian eagle owl who had escaped from the zoo.

They talk about birds in their relation to agriculture and as friends to farmers as playing a really important role in protecting crops from agricultural pests. And this isn't just farmers talking about it. You read people talking about birds like this in the Saturday Evening Post in Harper's Weekly. You hear sportsmen talking about it. You read in school manuals that children are getting problems about how to calculate how many destructive bugs each individual bird might eat over the course of several months. So it's really something that's throughout society that people are thinking about birds in this way. And the force behind this is a government bureau called the Bureau of Biological Survey that was established in 1885 to study this question to help farmers understand how they should feel about birds and what the impact of birds are or could be on, on their crops.

Little pieces of apples that they see and comparing it and saying, what are they doing that's helpful? How many destructive bugs are they eating?

Of course, the same hawk might also eat six chickens over the course of a year. And each chicken might be worth fifty cents to a farmer. So, you know, it does $20 worth of benefit to the farmer and $3 worth of harm. So this hawk, according to these economic ornithologists, they would tell farmers, this hawk is worth $17 to you. So.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (17:21): Sure. Right. So there were a handful of reasons why economic ornithology disappeared in the 1930s and the 1940s. And as you mentioned, a big one is that with the rise of effective and affordable pesticides and insecticides, farmers had much more control over the pests in their field. Before you had these pesticides, birds were kind of the best option that farmers had, and they had to rely on these almost natural methods of pest control. But that wasn't the only reason that this field kind of disappeared. There are also some pretty significant methodological limitations. So, first of all, it was not much of an applied science. They could show how many harmful bugs an individual bird might eat, but they didn't have reliable methods to show that. If you do, if you build a birdhouse, you'll be able to expect a 10% increase in yields on certain crops, or if you plant certain types of shrubs to attract birds, that you'll be able to see specific impacts on your crop yields. The second limitation is that they weren't really taking an ecological approach. They were looking at individual birds and how many bugs they might eat. And they were comparing kind of two facts that seem intuitive. On one hand, you know, in the 1920s, there were, every year bugs destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of crops. And economists estimate that between ten and 20% of crop yields every year were destroyed by insects. On the other hand, you have data on these birds that, you know, one single bird every day might eat 1200 cinch bugs, for example. And these are major pests for crops. And so you compare those things and you say, well, intuitively, more birds eating more bugs would mean that crop yields would improve. There is data now showing that birds do actually keep pests under control. But at the time, these economists weren't able to show that relationship. They weren't able to show that, like, baseline level of bugs would decrease when you had more, more birds. There were other, there were critics. A lot of them were entomologists studying, studying bugs that said, like, you know, if a bird is hanging around on your farm, you can actually prove that the bird is eating bugs on the farm. You know, they observed birds flying over to the river to eat bugs and coming back. And the ornithologist would shoot this bird and dissect its stomach and say, okay, it's eating all of these bugs, but they're not actually bugs that are preying on crops. So they weren't able to establish that relationship at the level of individual birds and bugs.", "edited_transcript": "Robert (17:21):\nSure. Right.

So, you know, and you read about this in attitudes. And as back as far back as the 1840s, 1850s, people had this idea that either through divine design or through Providence, all of nature kind of existed in this balance where, you know, bugs kept plant populations in check, birds kept bug populations in check, other predators kept bird populations in check. And. And when nature was in this, like, state of balance, you wouldn't have these massive infestations of bugs. You know, things would be stable. But with kind of the settlement of the country and, you know, clearing forests to make fields, humans had thrown off this balance, and birds were the only force keeping bug populations in check.

The rents are low, so the occupancy always stays high. And it was a bond business. And what changed in the early nineties is new York City at that time was in really bad shape. There's a lot of high budget deficits, high crime, all these foreclosed buildings costing the city hundreds of millions of dollars in property tax revenue. And in response to that dynamic, landlords claimed that the foreclosures and the blight were the fault of rent regulations. And if you think about this, doesn't really make sense because it's a self serving argument and sort of gets the causality backwards. Like every city in the country was having major problems resulting from deindustrialization, white flight, and these other mega trends, most of which did not have any form of rent regulation. So the real estate industry's claim was like, all right, if you let us raise the rents, then we'll fix up the buildings, property taxes will go up, etcetera. Politicians in the New York City council bought that and implemented a policy called vacancy decontrol, which allowed apartments to be deregulated in the buildings that we talked about once the legal rents breached a threshold of at the time was $2,000. That was later raised several times, and I think before it went away, the highest was $2,700. So at the time, legislators from places like Bushwick, which were very poor, where the highest rent in the neighborhood was $500, they could never imagine that a rent could get to $2,000.", "edited_transcript": "Ben: (09:18)\nRight.

And then people said they wanted to get the average hedge fund performance, just like people like to buy the index. They wanted to buy the index of hedge funds, and there wasn't one. So they created something called the fund of funds, which just added fees on fees. So essentially you had underlying hedge funds, and then there was a fund manager that selected these hedge funds, and they did extremely well from 2000 to 2007. And then in zero eight, all sorts of bad things happened. But what we found out was funder funds, the earlier iteration of the multi strategy fund, had all the downside and less of the upside, because what we had in zero eight was a lot of the underlying managers did poorly and people just wanted to get out of hedge funds as a whole. And the hedge funds started to get all these investors. And then the funder funds, which were one level removed from them, also gated the underlying investors. Right? So that created this whole thing where fund of funds as a concept became not a great idea. And so the next version of that now is this multi strategy fund. Essentially, you want to get index of different managers returns and you don't have the ability to do that yourself. So you go to a multi strategy platform and you end up getting a whole bunch of managers as a composite.", "edited_transcript": "Krishna (06:35):\nSo yeah, this is again a part of the evolution.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (10:55): Well, Keyman risk, but also the operational infrastructure you need and the reporting and all the other regulatory burdens that come with it is tremendous. So that's one aspect of the thing multistrategy fund is solving. But the other thing is the multistrategy fund is technically looking for good managers and providing them a platform so that they can actually run their business. And the multi strategy fund, the fund holding company, then provides all the other infrastructure needs, like risk management, reporting, all of that fun stuff. But if you think about why they have done so well in the recent past, I mean, part of it is just that we have this demand for leverage in the system. So if you think about what we did in the global financial crisis, obviously, in my view, the fiscal response was very timid. We spent about 3% of GDP compared to COVID. We spent 10% of GDP or more. So that meant that our recovery was very, very timid. And there was this whole thing with austerity, not just here, but elsewhere too, which meant that yields, real yields, collapsed and the overall return you could get on capital collapsed. So the only way for you now to generate any sort of return was to take a lot of leverage. Hedge funds as a whole are doing that. They provide you some form of leverage in terms of access. But the multi strategy funds take it to the next level, where one of the biggest problems with a single manager fund is often that you may not have that many good ideas. So if I'm a macro guy, I'm probably lucky if I find four good ideas in a year. The rest of the time, I don't know what to do. I have to keep busy. Now, if you're an investor paying 220 in fees, you want all the capital to be deployed at all times and to be invested in all sorts of things. So one of the problem the multistrategy fund solves is to make sure that capital is always deployed. They do that by applying a lot of leverage. A typical multistrategy fund, you give them a dollar, they have four or $5 of exposure, and they have multiple pods that are then essentially deploying that capital.", "edited_transcript": "Krishna (10:55):\nWell, the key man risk, but also the operational infrastructure you need.

I mean, it was much cheaper ten years ago when interest rates were close to zero everywhere, so you could borrow infinite amounts of money. And so if you think about the performance of these strategies, they've been phenomenal in that period. We need two things for a typical hedge fund or any sort of levered strategy to work, right. The assets you buy have to yield more than the cost of your funding. So if you go back in time, we had a positive upward sloping yield curve, which meant that you could borrow money at 1% and buy assets for to 3%. You could lever that up. And then even when we had two year notes here at half a percent, you could borrow money and buy two year JGBs FX, hedge it back, and generate a 2% quasi risk free return. And so there were many similar sort of trades that you could do. Historically, that was what I think fueled the performance of these strategies. And now, if you come to today, leverage is expensive. Most multi strategy funds are probably funding themselves at some spread, so maybe 6%. And the coupons you can buy, they're all much lower because we have an inverted yield curve where sofa is much higher than where any sort of coupon you can buy. So a lot of the strategies that are carry type strategies don't work as well. But then you have all these other quasi rv type thing where you're long and short, different things, and those sort of strategies tend to do better in this environment.", "edited_transcript": "Krishna (14:02):\nSo leverage is always expensive.

If a manager's strategy or approach isn't working, they're not going to be held around for long. I imagine another element to is style drift and making sure that pods are actually investing in the way in which they're sort of mandated. Because if you want that diversification benefit, you don't want, you know, some random, let's say, or some quant strategy or whatever to be like quietly, really just going long super micro in Nvidia, or finding a way to make just do a buy AI strategy, because that's what's hot right now to juice return.

Now you want to make sure, let's say you promised your lp's that you're not going to lose more than 10%. You want to manage each of the underlying strategies that you've deployed capital into to not lose more than 3%. Right? Because then, by definition, if all of them lose at the same time, you've now blown through your 10% limit. So that means that they all end up with some sort of risk management. That is not necessarily bad when you look at the platform as a whole, but from the perspective of what it does on a systemic basis, it's not great. So I know Joe mentioned this thing about the basis blowing up in March of 2020, but you have this episode every other month where you could have some random event which has nothing of any real significance, could cause like a little unwind of positions. Right? So what I mean by that is. So let's say you're going into the polish elections last year in September. You look at polish rates and Europol and the currency all kind of started to move in the wrong direction, meaning polish rates blew up and Europol and start to rally. And part of the issue there is that when you have a whole bunch of strategies that are all kind of risk managed the same way, it's no longer about the fundamentals.

Because I don't think it'd be very hard for the risk manager at some massive part to know every individual position. So they don't really kind, they kind of understand the whole thing, but they don't necessarily know that x or Y is what it is. Essentially what happens is your p and l drives risk management. If you draw down capital, you're getting delevered. Not only are you getting delevered, let's take Poland as a good example. And we have a position in Poland we followed closely. Imagine now you're at a pod and now you have a europoland position. Now you have to take it off because it's gone against you. And if you lose more than 3%, capital is going to get cut in half and you lose five, 6%, you're probably getting stopped out. That's typically how the pond capital gets allocated. So now you are now de risking that europolent position, which then causes everybody else to also de risk as well. So it's not even a risk management thing, it's just the structure where everybody is allocating capital in the same way, which means that, like an innocuous thing, like somebody literally coughing at some place causes something to move, and then next thing you know, a whole bunch of people have to unwind the positions.", "edited_transcript": "Krishna (23:26):\nYes.

Now, if it turns out that all the parts think that the earnings are going to be good, and if the earnings actually is not good, now we know that the stock is going to have a massive reaction because everybody will try to get out at the first possible time. You create these sort of mini crashes in equities and in other markets because of the way risk is managed.

It's just going to keep up with that, except that when you get into an event like you have a earnings release or Apple's Vision Pro is getting released at that time, now there is actually an event, and now you have to take a view on whether it's going to go up or down at that point in time."}

And a lot of what is happening now is money flowing into ETF's, which then end up buying whatever is the underlying index of stocks. And then you end up with these stocks that don't have a lot of free float. So you have large inflows. I mean, this is not just a us phenomenon like you look at what happened in Europe year to date, right? The top five, six stocks in market cap are up like 15%. Right. And same thing in Korea. Same thing. So everywhere in the world, as more money flows into these passive vehicles, I think it generates this effect where people are just buying it without actually looking at the valuation. So take Nvidia. As long as we have new money coming into the S and P 500, Nvidia stocks going to go up, and until something happens, as earnings comes out or something else changes, this thing drives the momentum effect. The pods, I think, have a little bit to do with it, but I would imagine the typical long short equity part is sector neutral and market neutral and all kinds of neutrals. Basically, they try to neutralize every possible factor that they could lose money against. That's what they do. I actually think that there might be a new factor that we might have to have, which is the multi strategy hard factor, because this is a factor if you have a stock in which a lot of multi strategy parts have a position that might make that stock behave differently.", "edited_transcript": "Krishna (27:55):\nYeah, I think to some extent that is probably the case, but I would say we probably have the ETFs to blame for that.

And they all have something in common. One of the things is if you have a very high sharpe ratio strategy. So a strategy where your volatility is small relative to your returns, then you're more likely to survive in this sort of hot environment, right? Because if you have your drawdowns are limited, and then every once in a while you might have a big blow up. But then that's just part of the high sharpe ratio game, right? So there's a very nice paper by Jean Philippe Bouchard that shows that most of these high sharpe ratio strategies often tend to have negative skew, the p and L profile, which kind of makes sense if you're going to sell s and p options every day, that's going to be a very high sharpe ratio strategy. Until something happens, and then you lose three, four years with a p and L.

If you're a bank, you also can't trade for your own account anymore. And so it all shifts into, I kind of hate this term nowadays, but the shadow banking system, and it gets done there. So I guess my question is, how worried should we be about this activity on a systemic basis? And then secondly, could multi strategy pod shops be hit if we were to see leverage get more expensive? So, for instance, there's a lot of talk right now about the basis trade in treasuries, and maybe regulators are going to start cracking down on that or making it more expensive to use treasury futures, which are basically a source of leverage in that market.

I'm still going to find something, but not as much of these rv type stuff. But the other aspect of it is what they're really serving, I think, which is one of the positives of the multi strat funds, is that unlike a fund of funds where you couldn't net risks together, here you're able to net all this exposure. Imagine you have one person long of Tesla and the other person short of Tesla. Now you as the end investor doesn't have to have these two positions and two different hedge funds. They're all getting netted and you're only getting charged for the net exposure. Cross margining, basically cross margining, which has been a big challenge.

And by that I mean like there have been a lot of new hedge fund launches over the last several months. I keep seeing headlines on the Bloomberg, many of them with the multi strat model. I imagine many people at multistrategy hedge funds want to be the guy on top rather than the pod with always having to worry about is their capital being pulled, so they leave and start something new. The returns for several of the existing ones are pretty extraordinary. Last year, I think Citadel's the Wellington fund, it was up over 15%. Like really a pretty solid year. Setting aside systemic events is the risk that, just like, the strategy is no longer as good, the more people into it, because typically that's how it is.

If you have a fairly large book, it's nearly impossible to get out. There's no exit liquidity for the trades. The size is a major factor in terms of how they would perform over time. Now, what does happen is the larger funds tend to have better financing terms because they've been around longer and so they've locked up all the funding. And so there is a definite benefit for the size. But from a forward looking return basis, you're going to be much better served in smaller multi strategy funds. Because multi strategy as a concept is not a bad idea, it's just that the size has become so big. And also think about how these managers are moving around. So imagine somebody had a great alpha source, some secret sauce, and they worked at a fund, and now their junior person moved to the fund across the street and starts to do the same thing. Now, essentially that's what's happening, is most of these strategies are the alpha is kind of decaying, right? Because you have all this migration of people. So you might say you have 50 or 40 multi strategy funds, but they might all be doing something very similar.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (05:54): Okay, so banks are a leverage business in the sense, if we start from the basics, that deposits put them in a leverage position right away. So by the time you take deposits, if we're talking about deposit taking banks, they already start with debt, unlike a company, like in a corporate finance course, where we stuck with the all equity firm as a kind of a starting point, where you're kind of investing your own money or your own shareholders money. So now you are already in an area in which the people managing the bank, to the extent they are not depositors, are immediately conflicted with depositors over how much equity they would have, how much risk they would take, because of the fact that depositors ultimately, if the bank defaults or if the bank goes into resolution or whatever, they might get paid or not. But the bank walked away with the upside in any case. So from that point on, the banks hate equity, the banker hates equity. So any leveraged equity holder has a resistance to leverage reduction. That's a pervasive phenomenon. And in fact, if you let them adjust leverage just once, it's not like we go to an optimal capital structure. Always up, always up. So that's the addictiveness of borrowing. Now, what's the business of bank? There is a basic conservation in the world. It's not an irrelevancy, it's not that it's irrelevant. It's just relevant in different ways to society and to the banker. The banker hates equity. From their perspective, any bit of it, you know, is, is too much. From society's perspective, having a huge more equity funding is only good and not bad. And in 15 years of asking the question why are we even here? Why do they have single digit, depending on all their risk weights, we can get into that. Why are we here? They didn't in the history of banking, and certainly relative to other corporations that are not regulated for leverage, even though we subsidize that in the tax code, you don't see corporations like that. How did they ever get away with that? Oh, how they get away with it is the safety nets, all these bailouts all the time, implicit and explicit. And that's really it. Because the conservation physics of finance that I'm talking about, the physics of money is there is risk to be born and taxes to be paid. And if you bear less of it, somebody else bears more of it. If you pay less of it, somebody else pays more of it. So the whole thing we're talking about is whether banks are subsidized to be leveraged, not just want to be leveraged, but encouraged to be leveraged by the system of taxes and subsidies. And therefore they're telling us that they should be getting all these subsidies blanket to their funding and then they'll do something good with it.", "edited_transcript": "Anat (05:54):\nOkay, so banks are a leveraged business in the sense, if we start from the basics, that deposits put them in a leverage position right away.

That's part of that. The bailouts, by the way, is a really complicated system. And you even touched on the flubs on the federal home loan banks. It's basically an interlocking set of institutions that are either providing guarantees or investing lending. So it's either the central banks that would make these excessive loans that we should get into the bank lending programs, and at the same time giving for a while higher interest on reserves, which is crazy, as well as the FDIC, which has started guaranteeing all deposits with extraordinarily dangerous situation, and sometimes guaranteeing other debt. After the financial crisis, they let even newly created bank holding companies that were investment banks the previous day, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, guarantees on all debt. Now, of course, they could go and raise money from investors guaranteed by the FDIC, which they can do cheaply, no strings attached, and return the top money the treasury gave them with tiny bit of strings attached. So it's basically a system between the Fed, the FDIC, and treasury and FHLBs, where there are sort of investments made in the. So basically the prevention of default, that's a bailout.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (11:22): So this is a great question, and it's a great way, in fact, to see what I'm saying. So what happens is they have definitions these days in the regulatory community of what a well capitalized bank is. It just so happened that both in the financial crisis and last spring, and now banks are considered well capitalized. And a lot of the banks that failed, including First Republic, got great camel ratings just before they failed. So they can say it's well capitalized. Now, why is that? Because the metrics are so bad. And the metrics include not recognizing fair market value on holding maturity assets. So the bank is pretending to have these assets that they bought at par value, even though they're losing value, like treasuries. In addition, capital ratios depend on risk weights, and the risk weights ignore interest rate risk entirely, only credit risk. So a treasury needs no equity backing. So even if you buy, you buy a treasury and you can do it, and 100% with deposit money, well, the treasury can lose in value. What happened in Silicon Valley bank was the following in banking in general, you know, being a zombie, being insolvent is Monday morning, okay. What they're showing is symptoms to a corporate doctor like myself, is every day the symptoms of the more they hate equity with a passion they hate equity, the more I think they have way too little of it. So that's that. Now, what happened in Silicon Valley bank? Two things. First of all, they had to sell some assets. So this hold to maturity might not actually work out for you. And the assets are worth less as you have to pay more on deposits. The assets are worth less because their long term have big duration risk and interest rates went down. So when they sold, they had to realize the losses. So all of a sudden, accounting rules that usually can allow you to hide the losses are forcing you to recognize the losses. So that was the first thing. Then basically, how would they survive? They were beginning to be more obviously, more visibly insolvent. So the next thing that happens is they try to raise equity, as you said, and they couldn't. Now, if you can raise equity, if somebody not at a price you like, but at a price, a penny, a dime for your equity, then you might still be insolvent, because there's only the upside. It's just an option on the upside, because you can always walk away as equity. But if you cannot raise equity, then you're really deep in the water. So the not raising equity is like the ultimate nail in the coffin. In other words, you're definitely insolvent at that point. The run was unavoidable because, you know, of course, maybe by now that they've guaranteed effectively everything, maybe people won't run, and maybe we consider that kicking the can down the road as a good financial stability measures. But that is extraordinarily dangerous, because in the eighties, we allowed all these zombie savings and loans to persist and raise money guaranteed by the taxpayers until, you know, we have to pay for it.", "edited_transcript": "Anat (11:22):\nSo this is a great question and it's a great way in fact to see what I'm saying.

So what's the problem now? So I've been asking for 15 years tell me again, what would go wrong if they retain their earnings? Just go. Take me through an argument, an economic argument, of how the economy would suffer. In other words, is their subsidy so big that God forbid they'll die, if they'll die or they can't survive, I question their business model. If the entire charter value that you like to talk about is subsidies, then we have to question the business model, just like you started by saying. So my point is the following. If you tell them, not a ratio, actually, I am against giving them ratios from where we are right now. You take them by the hand through issuance and retentions, because then they won't shrink inefficiently. Because a paper I wrote called levered ratchet actually shows the ways of deleveraging. And we show that there is a tendency to leverage through asset sales or stopping to lend or whatever, to shrinkage versus expansion. Well, I will expand. These are monstrous banks, which I'm saying to expand only because I believe that once they live in markets, once they're in equity markets, they will break up on their own inefficient weight because as conglomerates broke up in the eighties, because we don't need such complicated institutions. I was, you know, back in Davos in 2014 with Paul Singer of everybody, and he says, these are too opaque. I cannot put my analysts on it and understand their risk. They would not exist in market as they are right now. Once you push them more and more into equity markets. It's equity markets that are given them the stress test. That's my stress test.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (17:40): Oh, good. Such a good question because I often wonder that myself. Okay, so what motivated me in the beginning was, you know, I sort of fell in a rabbit hole when I started looking into banking. I'm not just a corporate finance, corporate governance person. And I look at those corporations, which I was teaching my students for 25 years, what a wonderful market we have. And all of a sudden that market, like, what just happened? And then I look at them and I say, okay, I understand about corporations. We don't talk specifically about banks because that's some other silo in economics. But if I look at them as a corporate finance person and I say, what's the same? And what's different about them? And all of a sudden, what's different about them is all bad. And what's different about them is what they get away with more than anything. You know, specialness of banks is literally what they get away with. Then the politics of banking, that's what's special. And then I all of a sudden realized, you know, if nobody understands what the word means, if the regulators are standing by, if the politicians want banks to make some loans or some campaign donations or whatever else, and nobody's exposing the nonsense that we have in this space that pervades this space that maintains and enables this to continue. So I was basically alarmed by people inside the Fed that terrible things are happening in Basel when they were negotiating that agreement. And I was encouraged by people both inside some places in the Fed and in the bank of England at the time, where I had most of my friends at the time, when Marvin King was there to get involved, and I truly didn't know what I was getting into when I agreed to do this. I was joking that I'm working for Andy Haldine, you know, that kind of thing. So he was at the bank of England at the time, and so was Mervyn King, who gave us a blurb for the book while the governor of the bank. So there were big, fierce battles at the time, post financial crisis, about the topic. And I felt, and I mobilized a lot of academics to help me, but it was very difficult work. You were at financial times at time, Tracy, and getting through even the opinion pages against bankers is impossible. And that's the opinion pages now in the politics, like, forget it. So I began to really see the politics, something I was not aware is so important in finance and how much it in banking. So I stayed in this debate just basically hating to be worn out more than anything, just not wanting for them with the resources that they have, with the amount of lobbying and the amount of money that they spend across the political system and the regulation system and global institutions and all of that, to kind of give up, because I felt a sense of duty basically, to society that I actually know something that's useful and it's my job to say it. But anyway, I worked on it for five, six years, and then I essentially wrote a few essays that were kind of putting it to bed around 2015 to 16. And that I'm back here is kind of almost didn't happen. It was a decade since the book was published.", "edited_transcript": "Anat (17:40):\nOh, good. Such a good question because I often wonder that myself. Okay. So what motivated me in the beginning was, you know, I sort of fell in a rabbit hole when I started looking into banking. I'm just a corporate finance, corporate governance person. And I look at those corporations, which I was teaching my students for 25 years, what a wonderful market we have. And all of a sudden  that market  like what just happened?"}

It's important because the risk weights are really the ones that reduce the assets by like a half or more and are gamed continuously and actually add to fragility because you give zero weight to government bonds, you give zero weight to risk weight. They're actually anti lending, the risk weights themselves. So that's a whole other can of worms. But we're against the risk weights, except maybe as a backup. Right now it's the leverage ratio. That is a 3% or maybe 5% ridiculous number. They are missing a digit is that we're not there, we're not close to where we need to be.

And I signed one letter by 30 academics who are kind of, you know, friends of the Fed supporting it, saying it's a step in the right direction. And then in my own letter on it, to which I attach a previous version of these 44 flawed claims and other writings, testimonies from the last 15 years, I said, well, you know, I hope it's not endgame because we will come back to it after another financial crisis, if not a bigger, you know, it has to be very spectacular because obviously the last one didn't, you know, affect it enough. In other words, it's really depressing how they always have these liquidity narratives and other things and focus on bailouts again instead of actually going. And, you know, Dodd Frank said no more bailouts, and there's plenty of authority to, to do anything, certainly to do even a lot more here on both supervision, which completely failed in this case, and on the target numbers and on making them more meaningful because they're still not meaningful. So why are we talking about it? I would say yes. These are kind of useless. Are they good? It depends how you enforce them. All of these rules end up not, you know, if you look just at the radar that shows you these ratios, you won't even know there was a financial crisis. The banks that needed the most bailout looked good all through the crisis. And that's a study that was also done after the crisis. So the bottom line is we don't like the metrics, we don't like the numbers, the range of numbers. And so I'm coming at it from completely the other side. I'm saying this continues to be poorly designed and inadequate. And in addition to this, I am not a hawk on other regulations. It's just this one is just correcting a huge distortion. It's only on the funding side. It's liquidity regulations that put money on the sidelines. It's the liquidity regulations that are costly in good times and useless in Iran. You know, so that's the problem. So a lot of living wheels, complicated risk weights, stress tests, I gave you my stress test, market stress test.

His first speech was okay, but afterwards the oh, we'll change it, we'll change it, whatever. Anyway, I mean I told him this to his face, you know, and offered my help to argue against all these flood claims. This is the manual of how to respond to all these. So heres the interesting things. When monetary policy, the Fed board is always unanimous. Like you know, when Kevin Walsh objected to Qes, he basically had to leave. Honig would object from the regional Reserve bank on monetary, on regulation, they dont have to be consensus. So he needs four out of seven. And you know, some of the support was tentative. Some of the statements that the governors made were full of flawed claims and I didn't get a chance to meet all of them, but I would welcome that. So I just think there's great confusion in a lot of politics and sort of ways of thinking and banking that are very entrenched. And so I don't know, I think, you know, what this proposal ultimately is doing is not changing the top head numbers, but tweaking risk weights a little bit. And by increasing the risk weight a little bit, that's a little bit more equity you have to have against a particular asset out of millions. Never mind that they don't take care of correlations and interest rate risk and other things, but just on the credit risk part. And so the banks are weaponizing this extremely disingenuously to make threats that you and you and you and you won't make a loan, which of course once they get the cheap funding, they'll do what they'll do. They'll maximize Roe, whatever. So the politics of it is really when I was in DC a couple of weeks ago, it was oozing from everywhere. The bombardment of lobbying was really shocking. It was never in the popular billboards and ads on your podcast. I mean, you know, I heard the ads on your podcast stop Basel endgame. They have explainers on that website that are wrong. You know, students coming into my course just out of the corporate finance course. It's like you're saying that equity is expensive because it's risky. What's wrong with all these companies that have plenty of equity and they don't choose to borrow even though there's no regulation? What are you talking about? This is absolute bread and butter finance leverage and risk. Risk and return. Required return is completely bread and butter.

No, I'm talking to lenders. Okay, great, great subject. Okay, so here's the thing, here's what's amazing about banks, and here's the real abnormality of the bank, the deposits of which, by the way, JP Morgan Chase now has two and a half trillion dollars. Okay? That is money, that is a very unusual debt because it has no collateral. This is important to understand, no collateral but has insurance, which effectively is now almost unbounded. So what happens is that the depositors are almost all the time completely passive. I mean if they'll panic one day, but they always just make telling them not to panic and just go about their business. So they sit there. Now once you have this funding, it's a good time, it's a good life, because you can use the assets as collateral for the other lenders. And the other lenders come in and they have collateral to their name, short term lending. So they feel they can almost like depositors, take the money out, withdraw it, and they have safe harbor laws that in bankruptcy they can actually walk away with a collateral. So if they, including the federal home loan banks, including even the fed, they are safe. So in the ratcheting of leverage and in the sort of race to maturity. So there's another related paper saying that there's a race to shorten maturity. And then of course there's collateral races. What you have is the ability to keep shortening maturity and to keep giving collateral as a way to free favor new lenders over old lenders.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (34:30): Has it existed in the past? Definitely before safety net. First of all, when banks were partnerships, not even limited liability corporations, they had 50% equity and unlimited liability for the Jamie Dimonds of the world. In other words, there was their own money, and they had to be the ones insuring depositors back in the 19th century. The depositors won't trust them otherwise. Somebody had to back it up. We go into a world in which we introduce after runs and panics and all of that. We introduced deposit insurance. We introduce central banks before that. So, equity, for example, when they started FDIC banks in Kansas, for example, they didn't want FDIC insurance, and they had 20% equity. So, in the history of banking, in the start of the 20th century, banks had 20, 30% equity. So it's not unheard of. The equity markets are more developed. If they have a business model, there are investors who will give to them at the appropriate prices. They just don't like those prices, because what they're telling equity investors is to take on risk. That's right now on other people, including governments and taxpayers. So the point is, you know, my banking system would look a lot safer, and all the deleveraging that would happen would happen much slower. You'd have a lot more time to intervene. As you see losses mount up. If you're looking, somebody should look. If it's not going to be the investors, it's going to have to be the regulators. And that's all there is to it. It's not rocket science. And on contingent capital, there has never been an argument why, at the point of that, you force them to issue those, because they also don't like those. Because maybe the long term unsecured investors might ask a question or two about the off chance that they would lose. They. In an interview in 2013, Stumpf, the CEO of Wells Fargo, said, we have a lot of retail deposits, and therefore we don't have a lot of debt. And I had a deposit with him, so he even forgot.

So there's reporting stores that report sales for consumer products into Iri data or Nielsen, they call it. Looking at the total population of the stores reporting in, Pepsi has been able to get us to about 98% acv. So we still got a lot of work to do on the placements in each store.

They're not going to devote shelf space unless they see that there is some evidence that if they devote shelf space that someone's going to buy it. What did you do? Different energy drinks seem to have different audiences or different. So I think some are probably more for the gamer space and some are more for eurotypes who go to clubs and listen to DJ's and some want to be associated with extreme sports and some are associated with construction sites and maybe more blue collar workers or truck drivers, et cetera.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (09:11): Well that's, that's the other thing you need to pay. You really need to have a target audience. You need to have a retailer story, you need to have a distributor story, you need to have a consumer story. So that's one thing that we've been able to work on over the years. The same retailer story and your distributor story or sales pitch might, you know, needs to be different than potentially the consumer pitch. When you look at it, it's really understanding your customer. You have to be customer centric. You have to understand why does your customer need your product? What is the reason? What is the void in maybe their portfolio? And at the end of the day, how can they make more money on your product? So as an example, to your point, there's different segments. So Celsius is really essential energy. So Celsius is Celsius. Live fit is our mantra. We have over 2.8 grams of vitamin. You mentioned biotin, Tracy's in the product and we have a variety. We have green tea and ginger, chromium, we have vitamin C and your b complexes. So a lot of great vitamins in there. It's almost like a multivitamin a can. And that really positions us as this healthy, better for you energy segment. And that's really what we, when speaking with our distributors, they had a void because historically it's been sugary energy drinks that they've had within their portfolio. And we were offering this different offering for them to sell for this better for you consumer, which is especially coming out of a post COVID world. Everyone's thinking about health and wellness and fitness, which is a key and a DNA component of who we are. We originally started off as a pre workout, but now we're aligned with today's health mining consumer with our attributes of accelerating metabolism and helping burn body fat. So really help you achieve your health and wellness goals. So that allowed us to position ourselves within the distributors as a unique offering within their portfolio. And that was our go to market strategy with our distributors and also with our retailers. To be able to carve that space out within those precious reset volts or planograms that retailers have. It's a multifaceted approach to gain planogram approval at your retailer and then get that distributor to actually get it on the shelf.", "edited_transcript": "John: (09:11)\nWell, that's the other thing, you really need to have a target audience.

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (11:20): So you mentioned how do your products get included on your retail shelf? So when you go to your retailer and you go to these chains, all those products are mainly orchestrated or designed based on planograms. So the products are pre selected by a buyer at the corporate office on almost like think of them as portfolio managers or like a mutual fund manager or so on. That's picking investments within their shared space to maximize the retail, maximize revenue for that retailer. So they're picking the right, they're picking the particular products for their consumer base to drive the highest return for that retailer. And that's all driven based on planograms. That's what buyers set and then those get provided to the, to the store levels to be able to set the shelves for the right strategy. And those strategies get reviewed multiple times a year. There's big annual reviews that happen usually in October and November, depending on the retailer. And then retailers will do like a mini cut in or a reset or a review right around mid year historically, where they'll make some changes to their planograms to really kind of dial in to maximize the opportunity. So, example, if a certain brand or certain flavors, you aren't working within the initial few months, they'll maybe get cut and they'll try new opportunities that come in. So, one thing, in a retail space, especially in the energy category, you really only have in some cases up to 45 days to perform on shelf. Otherwise you're out. So highly competitive, highly difficult, and it's really hard to compete in today's energy drink category and in beverage, just because it's dominated by, by really strong brands that are out there. And Celsius has been able to really rise to the top as we are the third largest energy drink brand right now in the United States. So we have over a ten share in the energy category for the first time. And just getting one share is practically near impossible.", "edited_transcript": "John: (11:20)\nSo you mentioned how do your products get included on your retail shelf?

I'm looking at one for detergent, and it's extremely colorful. But how do you convince companies that you deserve that space?

{"instruction": "For the Odd Lots transcript below, please edit lightly for clarity", "raw_transcript": "Speaker C (13:55): Yeah, that's the highly difficult thing to do. Usually it starts off, certain retailers are able to make regionalized or localized buying decisions. So those planograms you're looking at for the Clorox or the detergent set that you're looking at, those will be mandated down from corporate. But then on a localized level, let's say maybe 10%, maybe 15% of those plantograms can be adjusted for local store manager level customization. So what we did is we were able to work locally with a few managers at some of these key retailers to really focus on building a story. So gaining trial, working with the retailers, building a loyal consumer in that outlet, and then kind of scaling that to two to three stores, then eventually going to a region. So you start to build a sales story on why you need to be in that retailer and why you warrant maybe a larger regional or national rollout within the retailer. So it's really starting those grassroots stories and then being able to get that buyer meeting, which is so difficult to do at the corporate headquarters for their annual reviews, and then convincing the buyer why they need to bet on your product. I mean, ultimately, at the end of the day, you're trying to get the buyer at these retailers to invest in you as a brand, as a company. It's those type of strategies and you're going to have to convince a lot of it's emotion too, right? So in your early brand, the argument is, well, the brand doesn't travel. Maybe it's a certain community segment, certain income level demographics. So there's a lot of negativity. But you have to convince that buyer to believe. Once you convince that buyer to believe, you get the opportunity, then it's on you to perform. And if you can perform, then you continue to build the brand based on data that shows results. It shows that you need to get better placement in that planogram shows that you need to get additional flavors because you're offering a variety and opportunity. And the billboard effect is super critical. You need to get a billboard effect. So when we started, I'll take target as an example. When we first got listed nationally in Target, we only had two flavors authorized. That was on the warm shelf. And almost every year after that we were able to, because of the increase in sales and working with local managers, we were able to build that and get authorized for an additional flavor to be added into the target sets. But once we got to about five flavors at Target, we were able to create this like a billboard or Celsius brand on shelf, which started to be incremental. So when we added another flavor, it didn't cannibalize our sales, it actually increased our sales because more consumers can see the product because you create the billboard. Just think of last time, just think last week, how many new brands you tried in the last seven days. In the last 14 days and 30 days. It's really difficult to get a consumer to try a new product. You really only have about 30 seconds at best at retail, at that retail shelf to convince that consumer to try your product for the first time.", "edited_transcript": "John: (13:55)\nYeah, thats the highly difficult thing to do.

Well done on that. Let's talk about the distribution relationship. I have to imagine if Tracy and I were starting an energy drink, we would be desperate to get on part of Pepsi's distribution network early on. But then if we grew really big and the odd lots energy drink were huge, then I imagine that power relationship between us and Pepsi might change. And maybe in a few years we say, hey, Pepsi, you know what, maybe we want to change the terms of our contract. I'm sure you have a great relationship with Pepsi, so I don't want to say anything. I'm not trying to cause any trouble, but can you talk to us about how that relationship with the distributor changes or evolves as you grow bigger and have your own form of leverage?", "edited_transcript": "Joe: (17:17)\nYeah, I noticed at my local deli, I think I said this last time we talked about you guys, I remember like I was looking for the Celsius and I didn't see you.

If you think about all the trucks and warehouses and people and resources you're going to need to manage that. So when you look at monster as an example, they use the backend of coke and they're really focused on what they do best is portfolio management within sales and marketing teams.

How do you think about growing the brand? I looked in your recent quarterly call and you're talking about something with the Jake Paul fight, something with the MLS, an F1 partnership.

And we were just at the Arnold classic, familiar with that. It's the largest fitness show in the US. Big supporters of that show. Arnold drinking a galaxy vibe at the event. It was a lot of fun. Ton of athletes were all about the athletes and the inter athletes. And I think when you look at like Jake Paul, he's, yes, he's a massive influencer on social media, but he's also an athlete. He's boxing. He's going to be involved with the Olympics. He wants to be the number one boxer, world champion. So really Celsius is there supporting him achieve his health and wellness goals, then MLS is a great partnership for us. You got the World cup coming to North America, so the timing of that could be great. You also have a young consumer base of fans and followers that are Gen Z, 18 to 24 and growing. Soccer, you definitely need some essential energy. They're complete athletes that are always on the go. So we felt that was really aligning.

But when you look at our vitamin pack, you know, we're gaining more scale and volume, so we're gaining more leverage. So although pricing has gone up because of the increase in volume, we're able to offset some of that based on scale. The biggest challenge we had prior was actually the cans because of the aluminum as an example. During COVID there was basically a can shortage because everyone moved away, I guess, from fountain drinks and just started buying more cans, I guess, you know, no more I guess draft beer and whatever else we were buying at restaurants. Now we're had to buy canned products and have it at our house. So that put a major constraint on the can manufacturing to the point that can manufacturers were basically oversold and couldn't produce our cans. We actually had to work with some of our partners in Europe and around the world to source cans and actually wound up having to import cans into the United States, which is something that we weren't ready for. When you start to deal with importing charges and demerge charges, which I didn't even know what that is, but that's when you're product has to sit at port. And if for some reason it was shipped with a non union worker, then the barge or container you had couldn't get loaded on a truck. We learned so much. I feel really bad for our supply chain. They went through a lot of all the do's and don'ts and we mainly learned a lot of don'ts on what you do when you're importing product, which is materials, which is extremely difficult. So a lot of key learnings there. But that was probably the most difficult time we did source cans. We were in a position where we could that kept us to have, that allowed us to have product on shelf when many of our competitors were wrapping cans. I don't know if you saw, what's that even some, some cans today. If you're out and about and you look, you'll see some cans have like a plastic wrap around them. Number one, you can't recycle them, so that's not good for the environment. But number two as well is they're really expensive to produce. So that was a really difficult challenge and time for a lot of companies. And we strategically with our partners were able to find cans so we didn't have to deal with the wrapped cans that were out there during COVID You still see like smaller brands do it today just because they don't have the scale for the large runs.", "edited_transcript": "John: (31:05)\nYou know, now it's much better than it was during Covid, thats for sure.

So supply chain starting to normalize. Maybe some commodity prices are starting to normalize as well. When do you decide to pass those savings on to consumers? And more generally, I'm always just very, very interested in how these pricing decisions get made. Like what are the factors going into them? Is price something that you have to negotiate with distributors as well? I imagine they take some sort of cut, so if they want more, maybe you're tempted to raise prices. But how does that all work?", "edited_transcript": "Tracy: (33:19)\nSince you brought up packaging and the cans themselves, I did notice in your most recent results, you talked about profit margins being up primarily because packaging costs have gone down since the crisis.

So it's a constant battle. You have gas prices, aluminum prices, labor costs, as we all know, have gone up as well. And then also a lot of times inefficiencies within our supply chain is difficult as well. We have a model that we are building out as we further scale, and we're calling it an orbit model. And what that orbit model means is that we'll produce the product in a region, we'll source the product materials in a region, we'll build the product in a region, and then we'll sell the product within the region. And what that does, that allows you to be more efficient in your freight rates. That's probably the biggest area we have in savings, is really being able to be more strategic with our freight and trucks and shipping versus, as an example, when you're smaller, you're shipping from, say, North Carolina all the way to LA, right? Just because you can't produce the product in multiple markets just due to the limited run sizes that require that, you know, that are just. You can't run. You need to have a certain size run of product in order for it to be advantageous for co packers. So those are things we're working on regardless of pricing. You know, that's a channel strategy. It's pricing promotional strategies. The categories is very promotional. So it's 26 weeks on a year on average. You're on deal or on promo. So it's really trying to work strategically to be able to be at the right price to maintain your distributor's margins, your retailer's margins, and still be attractive for the overall consumer based on the pricing architecture within the category and space and channel you're operating in.", "edited_transcript": "John: (34:02)\nWell, you know, it's a really difficult environment because costs are going up, but then we're trying to offset them strategically as well.

And this started under Jim McNerney back in the late 2001st decade of the two thousands. He decided that the supplier base and the workforce were mere disposable commodities that should be crunched. They should be regarded as one giant atm. You take money out of them, there's no consequences. People will always want to work there, and people will always want to be suppliers. Our way or the highway, this was bound to have consequences. And it just got worse and worse through the. As a consequence, you had a badly demoralized workforce. Now, as part of his strategy, of course, McNerney, back in the 2010s, it became necessary to replace people on the board with people who had no technical degrees. They were one step away from being complete randos who sold accordions. And, you know, the most farcical moment was Nikki Haley was on it, and she left because she didn't think the company should be taking government money. It's a defense contractor. She was like, seriously? So it was a bizarre organization designed to rubber stamp and not much more. It's gotten a little bit better in the aftermath of the MCAS tragedies, but, oh, boy, that terrible culture of bad governance and that complete disconnect with the people who are charged with actually doing their jobs. A complete lack of redress and inability to push bad information. You know, I remember very well on 7807 when the 787 Dreamliner, their last clean sheet design was rolled in. And I was talking to McNerney and he told me, like, this plane's going to fly in September. Well, maybe October. Nope, it's September. I didn't say that. And it took someone, it took someone completely outside way lowered down on the organization chart to say, actually, Richard, that plane is filled with sand. It's not flying for another year.

It had been on a 30 year glide path towards irrelevance because of this focus on finance and nothing more. Between the creation of McDonald Nicholas in 1967 and its absorption into Boeing, it was pretty clear the way things were going all those years. Having said that, it was still an aerospace company.

They might as well be hedge fund managers or somebody who's merely concerned with numbers and has no knowledge of the industry whatsoever, came to rule.

But the idea of, well, even if there were cultural issues at the FAA, if you gave them more resources, at a minimum, it might end up with like more power for that organization, I think was the word rich used. I thought that was kind of interesting.", "edited_transcript": "Tracy (45:07):\nNo. And also just the sheer length of the development cycle for aircraft. So the last time Boeing launched something was literally decades ago. And now the idea that, well, if they don't launch anything in the next 10 years, then it could actually be, you know, you could have a whole generation of engineers that basically retire and are gone by 2040 when this thing is actually in the air and flying. It's just kind of amazing the lead times, and I guess how much the plane makers actually have to think on these super long timescales."}
